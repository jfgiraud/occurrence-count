NAME
       oc - Count occurrences of a string or pattern in each line of files

SYNOPSIS
       oc [OPTION] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       oc is a small utility to count occurences of a string or pattern in each line of files.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

OPTIONS
   Select and sort items
       -h
           Display help.

       -E pattern
           Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression.

       -F pattern
           Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings (instead of regular expressions), separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.

       -P
           Print the file name for each line. This is the default when there is more than one file to search.

       -p
           Suppress the prefixing of file names on output. This is the default when there is only one file (or only standard input) to search.

       -i
           Ignore case distinctions, so that characters that differ only in case match each other.

       -n
           Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.

       -o
           Print only the matching lines.

       -t
           Display the count of occurrences in the file

EXAMPLES
       Display only the count of lines which match the pattern (-n line number ; -o only matching)

           $ bin/oc -no -E 's[aei]' /etc/passwd
           22:1:messagebus:x:103:107::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin

           39:1:omi:x:999:998::/home/omi:/bin/false

       Display only the count of lines which match one of the given string (-P print file ; -i ignore case ; -o only matching ; -t display total count of file)

           $ bin/oc -Piot -F $'mes\ngno' /etc/passwd
           /etc/passwd:3:games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin
           /etc/passwd:1:messagebus:x:103:107::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
           /etc/passwd:1:gdm:x:116:122:Gnome Display Manager:/var/lib/gdm3:/bin/false
           /etc/passwd:#5
